* I decided to make StandardML the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-StandardML) as StandardML is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the StandardML programming language. It only makes sense to StandardML the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.

(* ^ Would it be possible to define all 4 strings on a single line? I could have put all of it (the 4 strings) in 1 line, but it would look bad and would be harder to read. *)
(* Like this:
string1() string2() string3() string4();
or like this:
string1(), string2(), string3(), string4();
or another way?
